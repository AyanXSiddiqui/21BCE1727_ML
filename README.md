# Document Retrieval System

This document retrieval system is designed to provide a backend solution that leverages modern technologies to efficiently retrieve documents based on user queries. It uses FastAPI for the web framework, PostgreSQL for the database, and includes features like caching with Redis to enhance performance.

## Features

- **FastAPI**: For efficient and easy to set up web APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: Robust and scalable database for storing documents.
- **Redis**: Used for caching responses to speed up document retrieval.
- **Docker**: Containerization of the application to ensure easy deployment and consistency across different environments.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Docker (optional)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

#### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

#### Installing Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Setting Up the Database

Ensure PostgreSQL is running and create a new database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE doc_retrieval;
```

Run migrations or create tables as required:

```bash
# Example command to create tables
python manage.py migrate
```

#### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and update it with your database credentials and other configurations:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost/doc_retrieval
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

### Running the Application

Run the FastAPI application using:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Usage

Describe how to use the system, including possible API calls and their effects.

### Example API Call

- **Health Check**

  ```bash
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/health
  ```

## Running the Tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system:

```bash
pytest
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Built With
